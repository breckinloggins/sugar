<name>* is a stack-based language with an emphasis on reading and evaluating source text.  In other words, the purpose is to 
"transform" it into any language you choose.  The language itself should remind you somewhat of FORTH.

It comes with a Java-based "IDE" that shows how the language itself can choose the syntax highlighting, completion assist, and 
other features as it is being written.

*<name> can't be Cx because that implies "C".  Mx maybe?  How about "Nihilo", from the latin "Nothing", which is what we start from?
